# DickensSounds
A script to visualize (or audiate) word frequencies within various texts, using Dickens's Bleak House and A Tale of Two Cities as tests.

Data visualization is typically visual. Textual elements such as word frequencies or character interactions are visualized as graphs, networks, maps, etc. However, I was inspired by a brief reference to sonic visualization in Miranda Marraccini's job talk at the University of Michigan Library on 2/27/19 to consider whether one could audiate textual elements rather than visualize them. What might be the sound of London in Bleak House, I wondered. Or the sound of the two cities in "A Tale of Two Cities." 

This script is part of my Recreational Reckoning (https://github.com/AnoffCobblah/RR-Recreational-Reckoning-Main) methodology.
